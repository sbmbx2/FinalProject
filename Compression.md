## 📦 Why Do We Compress Images?
Images can be huge. A single 4K image can be over **20 MB** uncompressed.

Compression reduces file size so images:

- Load faster  
- Use less storage  
- Can be sent through the internet easily

## 🗜 Types of Compression

### **1️⃣ Lossless Compression**
No data is lost. Images stay perfectly sharp.

**PNG uses lossless.**  
Good for:

- Logos  
- Text images  
- Transparent backgrounds  
- Artwork

---

### **2️⃣ Lossy Compression**
Some detail is intentionally removed to reduce size.

**JPEG uses lossy compression.**  
Good for:

- Photos  
- Thumbnails  
- Social media images  

Bad for:

- Text  
- Sharp graphics  
- Logos
