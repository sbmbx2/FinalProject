## 📸 What Is a Digital Image?
A digital image is a picture made from a grid of tiny squares called **pixels**.  
Each pixel contains color information, and when thousands or millions of pixels are combined, they form a recognizable image.

Digital images are everywhere:

- Phone photos  
- YouTube thumbnails  
- Screenshots  
- Social media posts  
- Video frames  
- Computer icons
